#' Compute the KL Divergence
#' 
#' From Wikipedia: "The Kullbackâ€“Leibler (KL) divergence (also called relative entropy and I-divergence) is a type of statistical distance that measures how one probability distribution P is different from a second, reference probability distribution Q. A simple interpretation of the KL divergence of P from Q is the expected excess surprise from using Q as a model when the actual distribution is P."  In scrattch.mapping this distance is required for computing categorical confidence calls used for assessing cell quality.

#' @param query_probabilities A matrix of query cell mapping probabilities where rows represents cells, columns represent clusters and values rowsum to 1. 
#' @param reference_probabilities A matrix of reference cluster probabilities where rows and columns both represents clusters values represent confusion between cluster mappings/clusterings and rowsum to 1. 
#' @param select.cl An (optional) vector of cluster ids (e.g., row/col names of reference_probabilities) representing clusters for which KL divergence should be calculated using
#' @param select.cells An (optional) vector of cell ids (e.g., row names of query_probabilities) representing cells for which KL divergence should be calculated on

#' @return A matrix of KL divergenes for each requested cell (row) in each requsted cluster (column)

#' Calculate tree mapping quality call

#' This function returns the "Good", "I1", "I2", "I3", "PoorQ" calls used to help assess Patch-seq quality.  These scores are based on a combination of KL divergence, correlation to the best matching type, and tree mapping to the top two types.
